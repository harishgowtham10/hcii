## **Eat Your Feelings Database**

---

![Eat Your Feelings](static/readme-assets/mockup-screenshot.png)
This webpage was created to showcase the skills I have learned in the Python Essentials/Backend Development section of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course; this is the third assignment I have completed thus far.
For this project I have chosen to create an online dessert focused cookbook using the MongoDB database, Python, Flask and Jinja.
The aim was to create a website that allows users to create an account, view other account holders recipes and add their own desserts to the database.

## **UX**


### **The Objective**

The objective of this website is to create an application that allows lovers of the sweeter things in life to sign up, login, create and edit their own recipes as well as browse the recipes of other users.

This app allows the user to:

- view dessert recipes created by other users
- read the ingredients needed for each recipe
- read the instructions on how to create each recipe
- see which user created each recipe
- see an image of each dessert (if added by the creator)
- Create an account
- login as an existing account holder
- log out of their account
- view their profile page showing the recipes they have created (if any)
- edit recipes they created
- delete recipes they created

### **Wireframes**

Link to Wireframes [here](https://www.figma.com/file/AYkebqGgPDhzMqU1ghJk1a/Eat-Your-Feeling-MS3?node-id=0%3A1) 

#### **Design Differences**

There are alot of differences between the original idea and the final website.

* Firstly more pages were create once I started getting into the making of the app including pages for the Profile, Create/Edit recipe & Error Pages (404, 500, etc) 
* Originally I planned to use the recipes page as my index.html page, however I decided against it as I felt by having them as seperate pages it allowed me to add a 'Disclaimer' explaining the purpose of the website and an area to advertise products a visitor of the site might like to purchase.
* I replaced the 'by' tag under the title of the recipes on the recipes page with a description box allowing the creator to highlight something about the recipe.
* I moved the 'by' tag to the recipe page under the image provided so people can see who made it.
* I removed the 'total, prep,' times and moved the ingredients under the image on the recipe page to let the content hug the edges of the box as I felt it looked more aesthically pleasing and worked better for responsiveness of the app.


### **Styling**

#### *Framework*
Bootstrap 5 has been used to form the structural layout of this website.

#### *Fonts*
The Google fonts Lobster and raleway have been used exclusively on the website

#### *Colors*
* There are two main colors used throughout the website:
    
    ![Colors](static/readme-assets/colours.png)
    *   #D9CFAC has been used for the Text & Boxes
    *   #614444 has been used for the Nav, Footer, Text, and Containers
    *   #f3da7e was used for focus and active clicks on buttons and anchor tags

## **Features**

* The Project is a multi-page website which uses a MongoDB database and Flask/Jinja/Python template management.

    1. The Index page consists of a Nav section and footer section that feature on every page. It also includes a disclaimer, telling the visitor abit about the website and provides links to products they might like to buy.
    ![Disclaimer](static/readme-assets/index-one.png)    
    ![Recommendations](static/readme-assets/index-two.png)       
    
    2. The recipes page displays the full database of desserts that users have created. Each recipe has its own card with an image of the dessert, it's name and descrption about the recipe. The title and image on all recipes work as links to the recipe page for that particular dessert. 
    ![Recipes](static/readme-assets/recipe-live.png)
    
    3. The Login and Sign Up sections take the user to the related page, allowing the customer to either login or sign up. The pages have links to each other in case the customer has click the wrong one.
    ![Login](static/readme-assets/login-live.png)
    ![Sign Up](static/readme-assets/signup-live.png)
    
    4. The create recipe page has a form which allows the user to add a recipe to the database.

    ![Edit Recipe](static/readme-assets/edit-recipe.png)
    
    7. The profile section shows the user their own creations which they can edit or delete if they wish.
    ![Profile](static/readme-assets/profile.png)
    
    8. The log out button logs the user out and returns them to the login page.
    ![Log Out](static/readme-assets/logout.png)

    9. I also include custom 404, 405 & 500 error pages incase the app is to ever crash.

    *   User must enter the correlating password already on the system
    *   If either of these points are not achieved a "incorrect/username or password" message flashes
    *   The link switching the user from login to sign up at the bottom of the form functions correctly

#### Profile page

    *   Pressing the logout button logs out the user and returns them to the login page

    
#### *Issues Found*

*   * An issue arose when adding fixed-top class to navbar. The titles of each page pushed up behind the navbar making them illegible.
        * Resolved by adding a padding-top to the body.

*   * Similar issues arose with the footer as it would float into the middle of the page and cover the main page content.
        * Resolved by setting the footer to fixed-bottom class and adding padding-bottom to the body so it didnt block any of the pages content.

*   * Footer covers some of the pages content when scrolled to the bottom on One Plus 8T mobile device but not on dev tools devices
        * Issue not resolved

*   * Issue with HTML validation of edit_recipe.html, 'The element button must not appear as a descendant of the a element.' However the code is identical to the anchor tags and buttons on profile.html and no error arises for that page.
        * Issue not resolved

14. Click on "Reveal Config Var".
15. Here you can inform Heroku of which variables will be required.
16. The required variables are: (IP, PORT, MONGO_URI, MONGODB_NAME, SECRET_KEY).
17. Go back to [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and make sure that you have pushed your requirements.txt and Procfile to the repo.
18. Return to Heroku and click on "Enable Automatic Deployment".
